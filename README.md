## **Background**
The motivation behind this project comes from my desire to understand the job market for data roles more effectively. I wanted to identify which skills are most in demand and whether a degree is still a crucial requirement. By analyzing real job postings, I aim to gain insights that can help job seekers focus on the right skills and qualifications.

The data for this analysis comes from [Insert Data Source], which includes job postings with details on job titles, required skills, and degree preferences.

The key questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries are:

1. What are the most in-demand job roles in data-related fields?
2. What skills are required for these roles?
3. Which skills are most frequently listed across job postings?
4. How important is a degree for securing a data-related job?

This analysis provides valuable insights for job seekers, recruiters, and industry professionals looking to stay ahead in the evolving job market.

## **Tools I Used**

In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to conduct my analysis:

- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** Used to query the database, extract insights, and answer key questions about job market trends.
- **PostgreSQL:** Served as the database management system for storing and analyzing job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Used as my SQL development environment for writing and executing queries efficiently.

## **The Analysis**

### **1. Dataset Overview: Job Postings by Country**

To understand the origin of this dataset, we first analyze the proportion of job postings by country. This helps identify where the majority of job postings come from and provides insight into the geographical distribution of hiring trends.

SQL Query:
```sql
-- propportion of dataset for each country -----------------
SELECT 
    job_country, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_jobs, 
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_postings_fact), 2) AS proportion_percent
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
GROUP BY 
    job_country
ORDER BY 
    proportion_percent DESC;
```
### Explanation:

- Counts the total number of job postings per country.
- Calculates the percentage of job postings for each country relative to the entire dataset.
- Groups the data by country and sorts it in descending order based on the proportion of job postings.

The results will help determine which countries contribute the most job postings in this dataset.

### **Findings:**

- The United States dominates the dataset, contributing over 26% of total job postings. This suggests a strong demand for data professionals in the U.S.
- India, United Kingdom, France, and Germany follow, each having a significant share of job postings. These countries are key players in the global job market for data-related roles.
- Countries like Spain, Singapore, and Sudan also show notable hiring activity, highlighting potential opportunities outside traditional job markets.
- This geographical distribution suggests that the dataset primarily reflects job trends in North America and Europe, with emerging markets also contributing to job postings.
